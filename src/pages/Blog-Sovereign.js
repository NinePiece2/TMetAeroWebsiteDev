      body="The Sovereign (2022-23) was the next generation of our primary aircraft, derived heavily from its predecessor, Leviathan (2021-22). The main difference being that The Sovereign was designed to carry significantly more payload while retaining relatively similar structural weight. The design featured a single-motor, conventional layout with a box-shaped fuselage for simplicity. The wing planform was altered to incorporate a rectangular inboard section and a tapered outboard section, departing from the previous aircraft's straightforward tapered wing configuration. This modification not only increased the payload capacity but also facilitated asymmetrical loading, which played a significant role in balancing the weight of the “targeting pod” mounted underneath the port-side wing."
